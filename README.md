# TaxPod CRM

A CRM system with an agentic AI assistant built for YYC taxPOD. Manages leads, opportunities, and activities with an AI agent that can query data, create records, and process meeting notes through natural language conversation.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Frontend | React 19, TypeScript 5.9, Vite, Ant Design 5 |
| Backend | NestJS 11, TypeScript 5.9, TypeORM |
| Database | PostgreSQL 17 |
| AI | Vercel AI SDK 6, Gemini 2.0 Flash (default) |
| Infrastructure | Docker Compose, pnpm workspaces |

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & Docker Compose
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 24 LTS
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone <repo-url>
cd taxpod-technical-interview
cp .env.example .env
# Add your GOOGLE_API_KEY to .env (get one at https://aistudio.google.com/)

# Option 1: Docker (full stack)
docker-compose up

# Option 2: Local development
pnpm install
docker-compose up db -d  # PostgreSQL only
pnpm seed                # Populate sample data
pnpm dev                 # Start both server and web
```

- **Web**: http://localhost:5173
- **API**: http://localhost:3000/api

## AI Agent

Navigate to the AI Agent page (`/agent`) to interact with the CRM through natural language.

### Example Prompts

- "Show me all prospects"
- "Which opportunities are in the Proposal stage?"
- "Create a new lead: John Smith, john@example.com, ABC Corp"
- "Log a meeting note: Discussed tax filing timeline with Ahmad"
- "What is the total value of opportunities in the Won stage?"
- "Update the status of John Smith to Customer"

### How It Works

- **Read operations** (searching leads, viewing details) execute automatically and display results inline.
- **Write operations** (creating leads, updating stages, logging activities) require confirmation before execution. The agent proposes the action and a confirmation card appears with the details and Confirm/Reject buttons.
